var Shape = {

/*
We build our coordinates for each possible shape configuration. 
A shape populates in a grid. The origin is at the top left.
The origin is not relative to the game board, or the window,
but relative to the position at which the shape is initially 
drawn in the window. So in terms of window, our origin is x=60, y=0.
Coordinates assume the top left corner of the "shape grid" is the origin.
